About this document

As applied in U.S. government, a designated successor shall be a different primary key
controlled by the same owner that is secured away from the current primary key in use,
to reduce the chance that verified key identities will be lost or disassociated in a
catastrophic event (e.g., theft, hardware failure, expiry, replacement).

The successor key shall be established using the same procedures for production use, but
kept in an undisclosed secure location, reserved only for future use.

In such an event whereby the primary key (identified by the fingerprint above) has been
compromised or is being superseded, this signed statement serves to appoint the following
primary key fingerprint(s) as its designated successor(s).
