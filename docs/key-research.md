# Key Research
Copyright (c) 2025 Matt Borja

## Abstract
This document demonstrates methodologies for corroborating key validity through a variety of circumstantial evidence, techniques, and rationale; as applied to a number of research cases. A framework of tools is provided as guidance to the reader to explain how each contribute to the effectiveness of research and to what extent they are to be used in assessments. The overall document is intended to produce a more holistic view of any given key, based on the spread of information available at the time of collection.

## Framework
**Search Engine Algorithm (SEA).** While not conclusively authoritative, search engines alone often contribute a certain degree of verity to the identity of official websites, including but not limited to content analysis, relevancy, and page ranking algorithms. Search engines typically consider external factors in the determination of page rank such as the amount of high quality links back to a given domain. To an extent, this provides a framework for trusting search engine results to a certain degree, backed by a large number of decentralized resources.

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).**

**Open Source (OSS).**

## Research Case: Node.js
### Inferrence of Domain
Node.js is a widely used JavaScript runtime, commonly found in high performing server-side applications, serverless APIs, microservices, and cloud-based development environments. Because of its widespread industry adoption in production environments, an official website must be publicly available for the general audience to access and download the runtime from. The de facto mode of discovery of said website will be through the use of also widely accepted search engines, such as Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc.

**Result:**
```yaml
Yield: Domain (https://nodejs.org/)
Method: SEA
Authority: DuckDuckGo
Reputation: +0
Chain: SEA
```

### PKI Verification
Given the implementation and requirements of the `https://` protocol, users are expected to carefully examine the certificate presented by the server to determine if it meets their expectations ([RFC 2818, ยง 3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2818#section-3.1)).

This can be done in the terminal using the `openssl s_client` command to observe that the certificate is [Domain Validated by Sectigo Limited](https://www.sectigo.com/ssl-certificates-tls/dv-domain-validation), a Certificate Authority and Lifecycle Management platform in use by a number of other high profile businesses:
```shell
$ date

$ openssl s_client -connect nodejs.org:443

### Inferrence of GPG Source
Borrowing from `Domain Validation` trust, it is both common and expected to find GPG sources involved in the cryptographic signing of artifacts that provide assurance to the user communities of the integrity and origin of released software. Therefore, public keys will typically be found on or in close connection to the same page where downloads are published.

Linear navigation sequence:
1. https://nodejs.org/en - Home page with Download button in main navigation
1. https://nodejs.org/en/download - Linked Download page with link in footnotes to "Learn how to verify signed SHASUMS" at external and open source GitHub repository resource presumably owned by same identity
1. https://github.com/nodejs/node#verifying-binaries - Linked external resource anchored to "Verifying binaries" section of the corresponding page with link to "the GPG keys of individuals authorized to create releases"
1. https://github.com/nodejs/node#release-keys - Linked list of identities, email addresses, and fingerprints of primary GPG keys and subkeys authorized to sign Node.js releases.

**Result:**
```yaml
Yield:
- GitHub repository (https://github.com/nodejs/node)
- Release signing keys (https://github.com/nodejs/node#release-keys)
Method: OSS
Authority: GitHub

```

### Fingerprint Corroboration
Noting the discovery of release signing keys has only been built on a singular chain of trust to this point (`SEA+PKI+OSS`), external corroborating sources should be researched and triaged to produce a more complete snapshot of the key, including but not limited to:

- Forums
- Blogs
- Mailing lists
- Archives

One way to begin researching external sources is to first take inventory of current (e.g., recently used) signing keys and scour the web for their external references:

```shell
$ curl -s https://nodejs.org/dist/v24.1.0/SHASUMS256.txt.sig | gpg --list-packets
# off=0 ctb=89 tag=2 hlen=3 plen=563
:signature packet: algo 1, keyid 21D900FFDB233756
        version 4, created 1747841356, md5len 0, sigclass 0x00
        digest algo 8, begin of digest 03 95
        hashed subpkt 33 len 21 (issuer fpr v4 C0D6248439F1D5604AAFFB4021D900FFDB233756)
        hashed subpkt 2 len 4 (sig created 2025-05-21)
        subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID 21D900FFDB233756)
        data: [4096 bits]
```

**Result:**
```yaml
Yield: Latest signer key ID (21D900FFDB233756)
Method: GPG
Authority: Domain Validation (nodejs.org)
Reputation: +0
Chain: SEA+PKI+OSS+GPG
```


#### Source Directory: SIG3
Host to an increasing volume of shared research, the [SIG3 project](https://sig3.dev/) serves as an ideal starting point for Rapid Identity Assessment (RIA) of submitted keys.

**Example:** **https://sig3.dev/#fpr=21D900FFDB233756**

By policy and schema enforcement, keys listed with SIG3 are accompanied by a collection of external references (`$.refs[N]`). For each reference listed (`R`), verifiers are equipped with the added knowledge of autonomous, third party sources demonstrating independent attestations of the key under assessment, including but not limited to the owner's activity, community acknowledgment, and the purview of intelligence and information sharing communities.

**Result:**
```yaml
Yield: Key references for signer ($.refs[N])
Method: SIG3
Authority: External references listed
Reputation: +(R x N)
Chain: SIG3+(R x N)
```

**Disclaimer.** Not all fingerprints are immediately available or complete and ready for querying. If you find a key ID to be missing and have corresponding evidence to submit, please consider contributing a new [SIG3-compliant JSON file](https://github.com/mattborja/sig3/blob/master/SCHEMA.md) to the registry by [forking the repository](https://github.com/mattborja/sig3/new/master/registry/) and submitting a pull request.
